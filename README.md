# MBTI-Predictor
Predicting MBTI personality type using machine learning approach
The main objective of this project is to predict the Myers-Briggs personality types by the natural
language from social media posts.

For this aim, the machine learning approach was used. I implemented three different models and trained them on the Kaggle MBTI dataset. 

Please refer to the "MBTI Predictore.pdf" for the detailed explanation of the project, dataset, MBTI system, approach, implemented models and results.

To see the implementation details, please check the "MBTI.ipynb" file in the repo. Note: This file only includes one most successfull implemented model: XGBoost Classifier.
